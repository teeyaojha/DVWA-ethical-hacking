# DVWA-ethical-hacking
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment and help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications. I worked on this web application, found its vulnerabilities and their exploitability, and then made a project report explaining my findings.
